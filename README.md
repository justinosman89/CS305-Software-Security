Artemis Financial was my client, seeking to enhance their software application's security. They required a secure communication and data transmission system, which led me to recommend and implement the SHA-256 encryption algorithm. This choice was driven by SHA-256's strong security features, such as collision resistance and integrity verification capabilities, ensuring the safeguarding of Artemis Financial's data transmissions.

I excelled in identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities, emphasizing the importance of secure coding to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches. Secure coding practices add immense value to a company's wellbeing by protecting against financial losses, legal issues, and reputational damage.

The vulnerability assessment phase, particularly the use of the OWASP Dependency Check Maven plugin, was both challenging and helpful. This tool enabled proactive identification and mitigation of security flaws in software dependencies.

To bolster security, I integrated multiple layers, including input validation, authentication enhancements, and secure communication protocols like HTTPS and SSL/TLS. Future assessments will continue to leverage tools like OWASP Dependency Check and follow a comprehensive vulnerability assessment process to decide on mitigation techniques.

Ensuring functional and secure software involved rigorous refactoring, followed by secondary and functional testing to verify the absence of new vulnerabilities. Industry-standard best practices and tools, including regular dependency checks, code reviews focused on security, and integrating security testing into the CI/CD pipeline, were instrumental in this process.

This project highlighted the importance of using strong security tools and practices. OWASP Dependency Check, SHA-256 encryption, HTTPS, SSL/TLS for secure communications, and a focus on secure coding practices were crucial. Employing these tools and practices ensures the development of secure software by identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities early in the development cycle. These methods are invaluable for future projects, showing the significance of security in software development and the necessity of staying updated with the latest security trends and tools.

For future employers, I would showcase the comprehensive strategy I employed in this project, emphasizing my proactive approach to security, ability to address vulnerabilities effectively, and adherence to industry standards for secure software development. This work demonstrates my skills, knowledge, and commitment to maintaining high security standards in software applications.
